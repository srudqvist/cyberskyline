# Enumeration & Exploitation

## Python 2 (easy)
Used `https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html` to decompile  
Wrote a loop to show the password, check python2.py  

## Python 3 (medium)
check the file

## Binary (medium)
give the file permission to be executable  
`chmod +x RE1_64bit`  
then run it using `./RE1_64bit 7074`  
when prompted for the password enter a really long password

## Binary (hard)
Follow the same steps to give it permissions and run.
